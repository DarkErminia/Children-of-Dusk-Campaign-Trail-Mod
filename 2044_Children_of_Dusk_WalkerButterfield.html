And I mean literally on fire, the entire country was lit up solely by his burning effigies and it was visible from space. Literally 90% of the population is protesting and out in the streets. Every company and every school agreed that this was more important than being at work. The president has been banned off every social media and has been blacklisted from 98% of all businesses in America.<br><br>The entire military had parked the entire army outside the White House with a guillotine, politely asking the president to resign, and several Congresspeople are there chanting with them.

He decided to be sensible (for the first time ever) and do something to help the country. First on the list was easing the debt crisis, and Robby had just the thing: Defaulting on the national debt.<br><br>And that was what these protests were about, everyone and I mean LITERALLY EVERYONE came out into the streets to politely ask Robby to reconsider his approach. Robby J came out of his besieged White House, in front of what was probably 5% of the entire country to give an address.<br><br>“I am going to make a statement. I will be making a statement. I will be making a statement,” he said. And the entire area was quiet. “I would be willing to compromise if you agree to give me more Tel Girls merch-”<br><br>A sniper shot rang out and shot Robby through the f---ing head.

He looked up at the great screen that stood over his election night rally, towering over him like a skyscraper. The map was awash with red. A great red serpent, come to swallow America whole, and drag it down into the deep from where it came. He stared back at it, gripping his microphone like he would a sword. For a moment, it was him, staring down the red dragon that had come to reap the future of America.<br><br>He felt he had come to the end of a great and exhausting battle, his body was covered in sweat, and he struggled to catch his breath. Even after everything he had done, he could still not overcome her. He laid down his arms, and conceded defeat towards the great adversary. But even though he was defeated, he still saw the silver lining. Red was not the only color that was on this map, there on the coasts, there were patches of blue. More patches of blue than expected. Growing out from them, were patches of resistance, a rebuke to the agenda of Cortez, a defiant cry, shouting “we will not go down softly”.<br><br>He smiled, then laughed. Even in defeat, he laughed. Even though he had fallen short of the final goal, he could still take home a worthy consolation prize. He had gotten close, far closer than anyone could have expected. He had made the monster bleed, and proven that the beast was not invincible.<br><br>“You are not as invulnerable as you think,” Walker whispered under his breath, talking to no one around him. “I have proven that even you can bleed. Even you can be overcome one day.”<br><br>“I might not have won, but I have come close. Closer than anyone had any right to believe. And that, that is worth something,” he whispered. “It may not be me, it may not be the person after me. But one day, your empire too, will fall. And daylight will shine once again, my dear Cortez.”<br><br>He laughed into the silent night, long after the room around him grew cold and empty.<br><br>"],
	
	frustrated_agenda:["https://i.imgur.com/KHL5YI9.png","<h3>Frustrated Agenda (2048 AD)</h3><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:235px;'><p>Come on, come on!” Cortez ordered her secretary, pacing around her office, quickly writing down notes, as her number of phone messages reached 15.<br><br>“Okay,” the stressed-out secretary stammered. “Major items on the agenda: You have a meeting with League of Free Nations this afternoon, a meeting with Evangelical church leaders the following morning. You scheduled a meeting with some Republican senators the afternoon after that to whip them into shape. You have a meeting with the CIA director over the continued threat of the Quebecois terror groups tomorrow evening, and you are being called to oversee the development of ANGEL this week.”<br><br>“What about my Patriotic Education Bill? What happened to that?” Cortez asked.<br><br>“It’s getting delayed in the Senate. Democrats are attempting a filibuster, not enough Republicans to enforce cloture.” The secretary responded.<br><br>“Damn it,” Cortez said. “Schedule me to go talk to the Senate Majority Leader and see if anything can be done. Give me a briefing of the latest news.”<br><br>“Unemployment has grown to 8%, income inequality has gotten worse, even though the economy continues to grow. France had a falling out with the Eurasian Union, and has proclaimed Greater France, the Secretary of State would like to meet with you with ideas on leveraging this to our advantage. Increasing authoritarianism in Canada, a second round of the Troubles have boiled over in Great Britain. Rumors spread across the Silent Veil, rumors of an underground Polish resistance force…”<br><br>The secretary caught her breath. “That’s all ma’am. Sometimes there are weeks where too many damn things happen.”<br><br>“And my approval ratings?” Cortez asked.<br><br>“45% ma’am. Recent polling suggests you would win an election held today with roughly 290 electoral votes,” the secretary replied.<br><br>Cortez breathed in and breathed out. “Okay, schedule all the foreign policy stuff in times when I am available, but keep my schedule free and open, I can’t be dealing with all this foreign policy stuff when we’re already behind on our domestic agenda. Get me a meeting with moderate Democrats, as many as you can muster, tell my speechwriter to start drafting something for the State of the Union address. Something about… American renewal, or something like that. I dunno, just tell him to start brainstorming ideas, we’ll workshop this later.”<br><br>“Right away ma’am,” the secretary said.<br><br>Cortez sighed. “And get yourself a coffee or something while you’re at it. It’s been a rough week. Make sure you don’t burn yourself out.”<br><br>“Thank you ma’am,” the secretary replied, and swiftly walked away.<br><br>There was a pause, Cortez sat down, leaned her head against her hand, and sighed.<br><br>“I don’t think it’s her who needs to avoid burning themselves out,” a familiar voice said behind her.<br><br>“Hello honey,” Cortez sighed, clearly out of it.<br><br>“Hello Victoria,” the man said. He locked the doors around him. He was Bartholomew Cortez, First Gentleman of the United States of America. Bart for short. “Are you feeling alright?”<br><br>Victoria began. “I’m fine, it’s just-” Her voice was strained and choked with frustration, but she couldn’t continue.<br><br>“Shh…” Bart said, hugging and patting her on the back. “It’s okay,” he said. “It’s okay,” he repeated. It’s incredible he was doing this with arguably the most powerful person in the world.<br><br>“Victoria,” Bart continued. “Everyone can see it. You’re burning yourself out. I know being president isn’t meant to be easy, but by all means, you’re doing too much.”<br><br>“It wasn’t supposed to be easy being governor, or mayor either,” Cortez said.<br><br>“But I’ve never seen you like this before,” Bart said. “We’re in the last year of your term. It might be okay to relax, just a little bit.”<br><br>Bart breathed in. “Look, you’ve already done amazing things for this country. No one, liberal or conservative will ever forget your presidency. You’ve changed the country more than any president since Franklin Roosevelt. Your impact will still be felt, a hundred years from now,” he paused. “So what are you missing? What are you searching for?”<br><br>Cortez closed her eyes, so tired and exhausted from all she had done. “There’s so much that I didn’t get to do. So much… I wanted to build God’s nation. I feel like I have let God down.”<br><br>“It’s okay,” Bart says. “No one gets to do all the things they set out to do. You’ve done a lot more for God than most people. That’s enough, Victoria. That’s enough.”<br><br>Victoria leaned into Bart’s arms. “I feel like I am building Herod’s Temple,” she said. “And it’s hundreds of years before the messiah will come.”<br><br>“No man knows the day or the hour,” Bart replied.<br><br>"],

Hui had not done anything particularly special; he just studied the path Walker walked down, leveraged the weaknesses found in the Cortezian coalition, and finished the job that Walker had started.<br><br>Hui had finally forced the Progressives to crack, after 8 years of the Cortezian nightmare, even their stubborn idealism could not stand another term under a Republican 3rd term. And Hui used the weight of the monster against it, allowing it to sink under the pressure of its own approval ratings. Hui was not the best candidate, he was not the worst, he was simply present when the monster finally fell, and America was under Democratic control once again, at least for a little while.<br><br>It would be nearly impossible to reverse everything Cortez had done, the Democratic-Progressive coalition in the House only had a narrow majority, and the Republican majority in the Senate still held firm. But at least the bleeding had been stemmed, the damage had been limited, and not everything had been lost.<br><br>The 5th Great Awakening lasted from the late 2030’s to the mid 2050’s, before ultimately fizzling out, the percentage of Christians stabilized around 80%, and the upwards trend of religious zeal was eventually halted. Cortezian orthodoxy has ruled the party for roughly 16 years, and without major disillusionment to the system, it will likely remain the Republican orthodoxy for some time. Somewhere down the line, the Republicans would win another election, but never would they have the same influence as the Mad Lady did, in her 8 years of power.<br><br>The descendants of the Awakening movement, the New Evangelicals, are beginning to fracture, with new sects rising up, as they always seem to do in Protestant dominated circles, creating a continuously competitive religious landscape, which some speculate might be responsible for America’s higher propensity towards religion.<br><br>In particular to look for is the Christian Forwardist movement, a strange mixture of progressive, Christian nationalist, and Futurist thinking that has spread across the center and the left, as opposed to the right.<br><br>"],

He look out towards the glittering skyline, and thought about the future, not only for him, but for the children he now fathered in this country. America would change now, it would forever be different from the country he grew up in. Cortez had already radically altered the Constitution, and now with Republican majorities in both House and Senate, there was not a lot he could do to stop them.<br><br>The problem was structural, it seemed every year the Awakening got stronger, and the ever-dwindling alliance of liberals, progressives, and Democrats got weaker. The conservative Christians were the only group in this country having enough kids, and they would create the next generation. And the next generation after that. Progressives refused to have kids unless they were wealthy, Cortez’s Christians would have kids no matter what.<br><br>He looked out towards the further future, he wondered if there was any future for liberalism in such a fallen world. Where would Cortez go from here, her movement, her people? Her coalition was vast and could go in one of many directions. Cortez herself favored democracy, but there were already factions who saw things differently. In a dark timeline, far from here, it is not inconceivable they too could seize power. Where would the Democratic Party go from here? He reckoned that the Democrats could win in 2048, but most likely only after greatly shifting further to the right. He sighed, the future of the Democratic Party was one of a right-wing party, or at least right wing, compared to today.<br><br>If there was to be light, it would have to emerge in the distant future, through the maze of future possibility. If there was light at the end of this tunnel, it must be down a foggy path he could not see. He looked into the vast paths of possibility open to America right now, he saw no light. He could only hope through the fog, the light would emerge.<br><br>He looked out towards the skyline one last time, feeling a great sense of melancholy and loss all the while.<br><br>“Goodnight America,” he whispered.<br><br>"],

The stadium had been completely packed, and she was treated as a rock star as she strode on stage. She takes the mic and looked into the eyes of her thousands of adoring fans.<br><br>“FOUR MORE YEARS!” they cheer. “FOUR MORE YEARS!”<br><br>“This is victory,” she said. “Not just for me, not just for the Republican Party, but for America. Four more years of putting families first. Four more years of unprecedented economic growth. America has come back, bigger and stronger than ever.”<br><br>The crowd cheered.<br><br>“But you know whose victory this really is?” Victoria Cortez asked. “This is God’s victory. From New York to Mumbai, this is only the first step towards a global Christian revolution. The Day of the Lord is coming, and this is just the first step towards the revolution.”<br><br>“When every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together,” she said, invoking the words of the Bible.<br><br>The crowd cheered, more loudly and fanatically than ever. Cortez smiled, she knew exactly what her base wanted, and exactly what she was fighting for. Most importantly, she knew this was exactly what God wanted.<br><br>“Tomorrow marks the dawn of a new age,” she said. “And one day God’s glory will shine from one end of the earth to the next. I truly believe this, I believe we will see it one day.”<br><br>The crowd cheered again.<br><br>“But until that day comes, I’m going to have to work night and day to ensure the new kingdom is built. When you wake up tomorrow, remember to spread the gospel, to fight for what is right, remember the promises of God, and work tirelessly until his kingdom comes. May God bless you all.”<br><br>Cortez walked off the stage to the sound of jubilant cheers, as the American national anthem began to slowly play. She walked with a spark in her eyes, a spark that gave her unrivaled determination. The transformation was not yet complete, and she would stop at nothing until the country was remade in her image.<br><br>"],

Cortez had just passed a great deal of socially conservative legislation, ones which were deemed heavily repulsive to the other nations of the League there. The League of Free Nations was all that was left of the pre-war Euro-American order, an alliance between the world’s remaining Western democracies. What was once a proud and powerful bloc was now greatly reduced. And yet they looked at Cortez in contempt.<br><br>Cortez was the only one sitting down, looking uninterested, while all the other leaders stood and surrounded her. She was picking her teeth while the other world leaders shot dirty looks at her. “Well? Care to explain why everyone is giving me dirty looks?”<br><br>Surrounding her was the leaders of the other members of the League of Free Nations. Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and New Zealand. All that was left of the Western democracies, after their loss in the 3rd World War.<br><br>Canadian Prime Minister McCullough was the first to speak up, his voice shaking with barely contained rage. “Your ideology is repugnant to the ideals of liberal democracy,” he said, with utter contempt. “Your entire ideology… Is simply put, a perversion of everything this alliance stands for.”<br><br>Cortez was still sitting down, looking uninterested. McCullough’s hands were balled up into fists, and the other League members looked at her from a distance. America was now the black sheep of the League. Cortez shrugged.<br><br>“The League of Free Nations has passed a resolution condemning the actions of your administration,” said British Prime Minister Buckingham. “And given your administration’s repulsive social policies, it may be wise for the United Kingdom to begin looking for strategic partners somewhere else-”<br><br>“Oh please,” Cortez said, she crossed her arms and glared upwards. She had finally had enough of this. “Where are you going to run to? The Eurasians? The Chinese? You going to cry to the international community? Just like the Palestinians did, after the Israelis evicted them from the West Bank?”<br><br>She paused. “Fact of the matter is, there is nowhere else to run. You all know just as much as I do that your countries are tied to the American sphere of influence. We make up 80% of the League’s GDP, military spending, and geopolitical influence. There is nowhere left to run. You really think you have the capacity to go it alone?” she asked. “Be. My. Guest.”<br><br>“Your ideology is an anachronism,” said Erlend Bjorge, Prime Minister of Norway, sweating a little bit, in Cortez’s presence. “You will be on the wrong side of history, one day.”<br><br>Cortez stared Bjorge in the eyes. “Liberal democracy has been dying for a long time. All of your nations get their culture downstream from America. The 5th Great Awakening has already spilled over our borders and into yours. America is the only nation in this godforsaken alliance with a naturally growing population. Your progressives don't have children. How many of your conservative movements have begun to emulate my methods?”<br><br>The other world leaders shuffled around in awkward silence. Everything Cortez said was true. And they felt what Walker felt, so many years ago. They thought that Cortez was a specter, an unwelcome ghost from the distant past. But now they saw something different in her, she was not a ghost from their past, but a harbinger of their future, not just for America, but for all of them.<br><br>“Now let me ask again,” Cortez said, menacingly. “Are we all good on the foreign policy objectives for the next few years?”<br><br>"],

Progressives, however, had little to celebrate.<br><br>“And we’re not going to leave this country to the whims of weak-minded progressives, or weak-minded fanatics anymore, you hear me?” Winston shouted into the microphone. “America is done holding back on the world stage, it is time we show those damn Chinese the eagle still has talons.”<br><br>Winston had led a hostile takeover of the Democratic Party, a new party, one that could fight the power of Cortez. The crowd cheered; Winston basked in its embrace. He had fought a long campaign, tooth and nail to be here. It wasn’t easy fighting the entire party establishment to get here, and to fight that bastard Tom Hayes in the general, but Winston had always done it his way, and no one else’s.<br><br>“I dream of America, big, beautiful, strong, and united. No longer will we be pushed around; no longer will we kowtow to the whims of other great powers. America will never again be the one on its knees, begging for mercy at the end of a peace negotiation. No, we will be the ones dictating the terms.”<br><br>The Conservative Civil War had finished, the schism between Christians and Conservatives ended up being irreconcilable, and they ended up in different parties. The Christians maintained their control over the Republican party. And the Conservatives...<br><br>“We are not your dad’s Democratic Party, no longer will the whims of this party be dictated by the technocratic elites in ivory towers. We are a proud, patriotic movement, for the people, by the people,” he paused, and pondered briefly before he used the next line. “God bless America, have a good night, folks.”<br><br>That was the only invocation of God during his entire speech, and it had been done carefully. The tripartite division of American politics was complete, the Republicans were what was to the right of the right, and the Progressives were now what was left of the left. And somewhere between the two, laid the Democrats, nominally in the “center”.<br><br>Even when Cortez was long gone from office, her influence would persist forever.

The tensions between the superpowers could not last forever, and in the year 2056, the worst fears of the world had come true.

He owned a bar, a place he built from the ground up. He attended to the establishment and wiped down the counters. It wasn’t much, but it was a place he owned, and could call his own. His bar was far from the urban centers and was therefore spared so far of Armageddon.<br><br>Few customers showed up in these days, but he continued to wipe down the counters, it helped him keep a sense of structure, a sense of schedule amidst all the chaos. Nuclear winter was still going on outside. Billions of people were already dead. And during this, a customer came in through the front doors.<br><br>He was different from everyone else he had encountered, a great black robe covered most of his body, and his face was dark and obscured. He looked to be very hairy, with a great beard. He walked with a limp, and he seemed to radiate heat around him.<br><br>“Give me whatever you have, I don’t care. Just get me something to drink,” the man ordered. His voice was raspy and deep and shook with barely throttled rage. He shook with great regret, like there was something he wanted to forget.<br><br>The bartender poured him a beer and slid it over. The man caught it, and the beer began to froth and churn, as if it was boiling. The man poured it into his mouth, steam rising up from his mouth. The bartender caught a glimpse of his eyes, they were glowing yellow.<br><br>“Give me another,” the man said, and the bartender obliged. The man downed several more drinks, this only barely intoxicating him. 6 drinks down, and he was barely buzzed.<br><br>“More!” he demanded.<br><br>The bartender poured him whisky, and the man downed it just as fast. He was growing more agitated. As whatever he was fighting couldn’t be easily drowned.<br><br>“Are… Are you okay?” the bartender asked.<br><br>The man stared back into the bartender’s eyes, his eyes were glowing a violent yellow, and his skin was hellish red. “Humans,” he said. “You had damn near everything they could give you. Food, water, a world hand-tailored to your species. A playground where you could live and thrive. You take that and look at what you’ve done with it.” He slammed his mug to the table. “What a disgrace.”<br><br>His skin continued to shine a crimson red, and his eyes a brilliant yellow. He continued to radiate heat around him. Like a lump of coal, slowly burning.<br><br>“Who- Who are you?” the bartender asked, becoming more unnerved by his unnatural skin and eyes.<br><br>“Who do you think I am?” the man asked back. His tone of voice was resentful, but also so, so tired.<br><br>“Sh-shouldn’t you be in-”<br><br>“The underground is empty, humans brought hell up to the surface, and now I'm stuck with you,” the man replied. “Now pour me another drink!”<br><br>The bartender poured another drink, his hands shaking while he did so, he slid it over. The man, after downing this one, finally seemed satisfied with his alcohol levels, He reached into his pockets, and pulled out a wad of American currency. His hands blackened and scorched the bills as he touched them, he placed them on the countertop.<br><br>“These won’t be worth much soon enough, the way your people are going,” he said. “Have a good night.”<br><br>The mysterious man stumbled out the door, mumbling bitterness at the world he now found himself in.<br><br>"],

By now, even the 2-party system she was a part of had broken down. Yet her legacy still remained. America still remained a Christianized nation, and perhaps, by now it was too late to change that fact.<br><br>Newly elected President Blaine Reed of the Patriotic Unionist Party was being given the tour around the White House, being briefed by the Secret Service as well as the other intelligence agencies of the United States.<br><br>“This is the nuclear bunker. Should the United States find itself under attack, you may be required to take shelter here until it's safe to return back to the surface.”<br><br>Reed carefully lowered himself into the bunker, him gaining a great sense of unease, just being here.<br><br>“In the case of a nuclear strike, you use your nuclear launch codes to activate TRINITY. And you would authorize a nuclear counterattack with this panel. This panel will allow you to launch America's nuclear triad at any potential threats we are facing.”<br><br>Reed simply stared at the panel, his unease growing. An ocean of emotions washed around inside his brain. “How many nukes do we still have?”<br><br>“The United States, as of right now, has somewhere around 3,000 actively deployed warheads, with another 10,000 in reserve. The United States under previous administrations has not quite filled up America's storage capacity ever since the Day of Nuclear Hail. We should practice initiating a retaliatory nuclear strike.”<br><br>“I will not.” Reed snapped. “I refuse to touch that button, even as practice. I... Say a nuclear war starts. Say our cold war with the European Ascendancy, it finally escalates. I would be condemning hundreds of millions of lives for no crime of their own, except for being born in a country they cannot leave. I cannot do it.”<br><br>Reed closed his eyes and remembered his childhood. He had lived through the horrors of a nuclear war, gathered around a radio as cities were wiped off the map. The panicked phone calls to loved ones you feared were now dead. The hours upon hours upon uncertainty, as civilization broke down around you, and you had no idea if huge swathes of people you knew were alive or dead. And then the slow trickle of news in the coming weeks; alive, dead, alive, alive, dead. Reed had grown up through the horrors of the Day of Nuclear Hail. They were known as Children of the Atom, borne in the wake of its radioactive ashes.<br><br>He opened his eyes. “TRINITY will protect us. My administration will use every measure possible to retaliate against such a heinous act. But this world cannot afford another Long Winter, another Day of Nuclear Hail. We cannot have another Great Bleeding. The last nuclear war, the only nuclear war we've ever fought, mind you, killed 3 billion people. I refuse to subject the people of another country through what we went through. Never again.”<br><br>...<br><br>All over the world, this sentiment was common, as the children who lived through the 4th World War, the Rubble Generation, came to power. Becoming politicians, presidents, and every other position of power. Nearly everyone had known someone who had died in the conflict. Even some of the AIs had trauma from the horrors of the 4th World War. The older generations talked about “the old world”, the world that was before the nuclear holocaust that brought an end to it all.<br><br>They showed the younger generations the photos of the skylines of cities as they used to be. Old New York, Old Beijing, Old Moscow, and then drive there and see that everything was now different. The old world was gone, and the new world had been constructed on its ruins. They would never get to see the old Big Ben, or the old Trade Center, or the old Statue of Liberty, landmarks and structures that had captured the imaginations of the old generations, but were now alien to the newer generations.<br><br>LIBERTY mourned Old America, JIN DUN himself would mourn over the loss of Old China.

Your fathers died so they could fix the world your great-grandfathers had broken.” said a diplomat. He was a bit older than the political leaders which surrounded him. But he was one of the first to have noticed that now the generation who had grown up in the 4th World War was now the one in power. Sensing an opportunity for something truly historic, he had seized the chance for lasting peace. “No one should ever have to live through another Long Winter. Another Day of Nuclear Hail. We should take this burden upon ourselves and say that we will be the last generation that will ever have to carry such a burden.

She came with her husband, Robert Alinor, and her 6 kids. She was not the first family to make this trip, nor would she be the last. She, like many Evangelical Christians at the time, were motivated by an ideological mission, to settle the stars and to keep the fire of Christianity burning.<br><br>America was too secular for them, see. Though America saluted the cross and pledged fealty to the Lord, that was not enough for them; America had clearly lost its way.

She was far from the first, and she knew she would be far from the last.<br><br>Her husband, Robert, did some math. He estimated the average birthrate of the people around him could not have been any lower than 4, and new arrivals consistently arrived from the United States, primarily Christians. He saw the open space around him and knew it would not be open for long. Still, a whole new world would be pretty empty for now, and it would be generations from now before they had colonized the entire thing. He reckoned it would not be long until America was joined by the rest of the great powers.<br><br>In particular, he knew of one colony ship consisting primarily of American Catholics, who would be landing in the nearby territory of Cortez. He recoiled in disgust, the thought of the new world of the Lord being tainted by filthy papists.

He saw their faces, white, black, brown, yellow, every kind of person from all walks of life. He still wasn’t sure how, but he had done it. He remembered staring down the map 8 months ago, when the map was a sea of red, and he stared down 400 electoral votes with only less than a hundred of his own. Yet here he was, months later, celebrating victory.<br><br>A coalition of the willing, rallied together against the agenda of Cortez, he cobbled together a new coalition, and brought the Democrats back from the brink of defeat. But seeing the dark path America was about to go down, did he ever really doubt himself? Yes. Yes he did. But now he was here, against the odds.<br><br>For the first time, his voice was not the measured, the controlled politician tone he usually carried himself with was no longer there. After 8 grueling months on the campaign trail, he just wanted to speak from the heart, and speak how he really felt.<br><br>“8 months ago, I began my campaign as the Democratic Candidate, fresh out of the primaries. I had barely been elected by the slimmest of margins, thrown out into the wild against the most formidable political opponent of our times,” he said. If nothing else, he had to respect Cortez as an opponent. Defeating her was not easy, beads of sweat still remained from the sweat and tears he went through.<br><br>“With a divided party, weak voter enthusiasm, and the creeping mold of Cortezian conservatism growing, day by day, I stared down the map I was facing. 400 electoral votes for Cortez, against my measly less than 100. This was less of an uphill battle, and more a vertical climb.” He continued.<br><br>“I had to cobble together new coalitions from nothing. Pull out every stop I could, and find new partners that could be brought together, a coalition of the willing against the insanity of Cortez,” he said. “But here I am.”<br><br>The crowd cheered his name, again and again. “After all the people I met, all the new wrangling I had to do. In the Senate and in the office and on the campaign trail, did I ever really doubt myself?” he asked, a kind of confident arrogance rising in his voice. The crowd cheered. “Yes, I did,” he said, his tone of voice changing abruptly. The crowd went quiet. “I really did. There was never a day that passed when I didn’t feel that I was fighting some kind of all-consuming vortex, that today was the day, the day when my poll numbers would plunge for the final time, and everything would be lost.”<br><br>“But that day never came. I made mistakes, and I plunged in the polls plenty of times,” Walker said. “But they were never enough to knock me out. I kept going forward, climbing step after step, closer to the summit. Whatever the world threw at me, whatever Cortez and her campaign team threw at me, I took them, and I fought back.”<br><br>“Even when I finally peaked ahead in the polls I still lived in fear,” Walker said. “That Cortez would defy the polls and pull ahead. That she would pull some kind of trump card at the 11th hour. But that event never came, and I realized that people you consider to be invincible turn out to be not so invincible after all, and maybe our problems aren’t so big when you put your mind to them.”<br><br>The crowd was silent. The lights beamed down on Walker’s face. He considered pulling out, pulling back, but he shook his head.

There were decades worth of damage done through Cortez’s supermajority. Her influence was in the school systems, the universities, the big tech companies, and the bureaucracy. States and institutions would fight you, and you realize it would be a long time before things could return to the way they could be.<br><br>But none of that mattered today. You managed to repeal one of the most important bills of all of the Cortez administration, and the fruits of your labor were clear in front of you. You were at a wedding, a favor, for two friends of yours. A local priest was asked to do the honors. He was a trusted friend; properly vetted and everything.<br><br>“Amy, do you take Rachel to be your wedded wife, to live together in marriage?  Do you promise to love her, comfort her, honor and keep her for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health, and forsaking all others, be faithful only to her, for as long as you both shall live?” the priest asked.<br><br>“I do,” Amy said.<br><br>“Then I join you two together in holy matrimony, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.” The priest said, and the two kissed.<br><br>Walker breathed a small breath of relief as it came, he reminded himself though his duties were grand and presidential, this is what he was really fighting for. The duties of a president weren’t found charted on a map, or in diplomatic meeting rooms, ones that will decide the fate of nations, or even as a stack of papers, which found themselves on his desk, waiting to be signed. No, they were to be found in people on the ground, in the trenches of everyday life. He did this for them, he did it for the American people.<br><br>“Let’s give special thanks to our friend Patrick Walker, who allowed this wedding to take place!” Rachel said.<br><br>“Don’t mention it,” Walker said, smiling, but still a bit tired. “Don’t mention it.”<br><br>“Guess they let you take a day off, eh?” Rachel asked. “How are you holding up?”<br><br>Walker looked up towards the ceiling. “God helps me get through it.”<br><br>“Don’t mention his name,” Amy hissed. “We still don’t know if he’s on our side.”<br><br>“I’d say he’s been on my side so far,” Walker laughed weakly.<br><br>“I’m just saying, the Awakening came from somewhere, and I’m not sure I can forgive him for that just yet,” Amy said, hurt.<br><br>“Amy,” Rachel replied. “Don’t say stuff like that, I’m Catholic, remember?”<br><br>This was… Contentiously disputed. The Progressive Catholics had only separated from the church in Rome months prior, over the same issue of same-sex marriage.<br><br> “I know, it’s just that, it still hurts,” Amy said.<br><br>“Hey,” Rachel said, putting her arms around Amy’s shoulders. “It’s alright, I love you, remember?”<br><br>Rachel wiped a tear away from Amy’s eyes, and they walked down the aisle together. Walker remained, staring into the light above.<br><br>“God,” he asked, in something barely more audible than a whisper. “Are you really on my side or am I on the wrong side of history?” he asked.<br><br>His mind was conflicted, all these months of stress had brought him closer to the aura of the divine. And in these moments, he really wondered if Cortez really had a divine mandate behind her, and whether her actions were sanctioned by the Almighty above.<br><br>Receiving no answers, he walked away, still contemplating the depth of the Almighty above.<br><br>"],

The fight was long from over, after this, the rest of the Havana Internationale would surely join in a brutal war.

He wondered whose godforsaken idea it was to send soldiers unprepared into a damn jungle.<br><br>America had been here for 8 years, what was supposed to be a “quick” and “easy” operation turned into a quagmire, with no end in sight. After all this time, America had trouble just holding down Cuba and Mexico, much less the rest of the Havana Internationale. Brazil pulled out of the war years ago, North Mexico was now a battleground. Far-left militias had launched several attacks into the United States itself.<br><br>Walker’s lukewarm attitude towards the military quickly did a 180 as failures began to pile up. Neither the Democratic nor Republican administration that came after it could fix the problem. The war dragged on Walker’s popularity until he was dragged out of office, practically tarred and feathered by the American people. But not even the magic touch of Cortez’s second term could fix this mess. More and more money was funneled into it, but every bomb, every killing turned the civilian populations more and more hostile, as calls for peace piled up at home.<br><br>All the while, the war allowed Eurasia and China to expand their influence, while America was pre-occupied subduing Latin America. Finally, a following pacifist Democratic administration threw in the towel, retreating from the expedition as a humiliating defeat for America’s foreign policy.<br><br>"],

Now he floated, somewhere, and he felt, somewhen, outside of time.<br><br>“Damn it,” Walker said, drifting in and out of a blank, white void. “What’s happening? What…”<br><br>He sat next to a bearded man with antlers, obscured by the darkness, yet his heart glowed a radiant white. His skin was the color of burnished bronze, and his hands and side were pierced for our inequities. Upon his head was a crown of thorns.<br><br>“You brought yourself back here,” the Thornking said. His voice echoed in a thousand different languages, and a thousand different voices. “Because you blame yourself for what happened, you relive these moments, hoping you can get a second chance. But there are no second chances. In the end, we only live in one world, and one reality.

And suddenly, it all came back to him.<br><br>He never won the Democratic primaries, he had come in second place. He had lost to a jackass named Landon Madoff. A smug, arrogant asshole who used his charisma to ride his way to victory, carried there by his legions of adoring progressive fans. Walker came in second place, cobbling together a coalition of moderates and liberals.<br><br>And from there, he was forced to watch from the sidelines as Madoff threw the election, harder than anyone he had ever seen before. He reflected the worst of the Cortezian excesses off of him, descending the country into chaos, guided by his own self-righteous violence.<br><br>He would always fight fire with fire, going to extremes not even Cortez had imagined.

An antifascist mob, returning violence with violence on the streets of Times Square.<br><br>But that was just one part of it. Walker picked up a framed photo, a picture of himself, and his son Danny. He first lost his son to the Awakening, being swept up in the waves of religious fanaticism gripping the nation. They had a fight, and they broke off. He picked up the red hat, donned the rifle, and he stood up for what he thought was right. And now he lay dead in Times Square.<br><br>He blamed Cortez, for losing him the first time, he blamed Madoff, for losing him the second time. And he blamed himself, for losing him at all. And since then, he’s been lost here, struggling to let go.<br><br>He remembered all the cycles; he remembered all the dreams. They all ended by the 2060’s. His brain could no longer forecast what laid beyond that hazy barrier. He recalled the events of the past few years. Cortez won, then Winston, and now, America looked to be on the brink of another world war.<br><br>He had spent the last few months living in the past, so he could never look into the future. That’s why the dreams always fizzled out around the 2060’s.  He shook his head and got ready for the day.
